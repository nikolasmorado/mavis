# Mavis, a resource fetching utility
Fetching with saving requests

Named after my cat mavis who likes to play fetch


### Todo:
- Stashing, configurable with hcl or toml files or something else, havent decided but dont want json it smells bad
- Chaining requests
- Optionally supply data with files
- Support output to files instead of only stdout
- More robustness
- Add picture or video of mavis playing fetch to the readme or something so people believe me
